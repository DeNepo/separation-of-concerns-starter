## General info

This is group project assignation for  [HYFBelgium](https://hackyourfuture.be/) module: [separation-of-concerns](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/separation-of-concerns) week 3. This time we are going to develop a "To do list" from scratch using the knowledge acquired during this course.

Based in  our user stories, we will create our strategy and then, doing reversed-engineering of different sites and applications from our choice, we are going to develop our own site.

Each member of the group is going to work in a different task according to our strategy. Our communication plan is vital to keep the communication permanent between all the members to help each other with any issue.

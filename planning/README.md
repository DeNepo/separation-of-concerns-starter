# To Do List

## Group Project #3

This is group project assignation for  [HYFBelgium](https://hackyourfuture.be/) module: [separation-of-concerns](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/separation-of-concerns) week 3. This time we are going to develop a "To do list" from scratch using the knowledge acquired during this course.

Based in  our user stories, we will create our strategy and then, doing reversed-engineering of different sites and applications from our choice, we are going to develop our own site.

Each member of the group is going to work in a different task according to our strategy. Our communication plan is vital to keep the communication permanent between all the members to help each other with any issue.

Here we can see some options we are considering:
